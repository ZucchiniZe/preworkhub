## Notes

All the videos are recoreded with the same acpect ratio and are uploaded to google drive so we can easly embed the videos in the current page using the following code:

`<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/{file_id}/preview" width="770" height="480"></iframe>`

Note the width and heigh in the URL. A width of 770 and height of 480 makes the video be perfectly stretched to fill the iframe.
